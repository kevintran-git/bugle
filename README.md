# Bugle

Bugle is a Flutter app that allows you to chat with your friends, schedule events, and manage your availability. Bugle uses Firebase for authentication, storage, and database.

## Features

- Sign in with Google or anonymously
- Add and delete friends
- View friends' status and profile picture
- Create and join groups
- Sync your calendar events with Google Calendar
- Set your availability preferences

## Installation

To run this app, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine. Follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up Flutter.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

You also need to create a Firebase project and enable the following services:

- Firebase Authentication (with Google Sign-In provider)
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase Storage

Follow the instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to set up Firebase for Flutter.

You need to add the following files to your project:

- android/app/google-services.json (downloaded from Firebase console)
- ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist (downloaded from Firebase console)
- lib/firebase_options.dart (generated by FlutterFire CLI)

## Installing FlutterFire

FlutterFire is needed to use Firebase services in the app. It is a set of plugins that provides access to Firebase APIs. FlutterFire CLI is used to generate the configuration files to connect the app to our Firebase project.

- Install the FlutterFire CLI tool by running `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`.
- Run `flutterfire configure` to connect your Flutter app with your Firebase project.
- Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project, your app platform (Android or iOS), and your app bundle ID or package name.
- The CLI tool will generate a firebase_options.dart file in your lib folder, which contains the Firebase configuration for your app. You need to import this file in your main.dart file and pass it to the `Firebase.initializeApp()` method.

## Usage

To download the app's dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

To run the app in debug mode, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

To build the app for release, use the following command:

```bash
flutter build apk # for Android
flutter build ios # for iOS
```
